A note on why MASON's getName method doesn't work with Clojure
Marshall Abrams

This is due to an obscure corner of the already obscure gen-class
corner: When a method has multiple arities in the super, you have to
distinguish them by tacking type specifiers on to the name of the
method!

Example:

(defn -getName-void [this] "free-agent") ; override method in super. should cause this to be displayed as title of config window of gui, but it doesn't.

cf also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26425098/how-to-generate-generate-static-methods-with-clojures-gen-class
but note that you're not supposed to put a signature in :methods if it's already in the superclass.
